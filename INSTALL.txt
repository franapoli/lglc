A Makefile can be generated using cmake (you need to install cmake if
you don't have it already).

In order to create the Makefile:

   > cd build
   > cmake ..

Then to build lglc:

   > make

Or to install it:

   > make install

Once installed, test lglc by issuing the following command from the
samples directory:

   > lglc test.lf

You should get a file named test.lf.dot. If you have Graphviz
installed (http://www.graphviz.org), you can obtain a pdf graph
visualization:

   > dot test.lf.dot -o test.pdf
