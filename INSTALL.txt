BUILDING AND INSTALLING lglc

A Makefile can be generated using cmake (you need to install cmake if
you don't have it already).

In order to create the Makefile starting from the root directory of
this package:

   > cd build
   > cmake ..

Then to build lglc:

   > make

Or to install it (make sure you have proper permissions - aka root -
to do this):

   > make install

Once installed, test lglc by issuing the following command from the
samples directory:

   > lglc test.lf

You should get a file named test.lf.dot. If you have Graphviz
installed (http://www.graphviz.org), you can obtain a pdf graph
visualization this way:

   > dot -Tpdf test.lf.dot -o test.pdf
